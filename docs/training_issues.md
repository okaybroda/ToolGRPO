# Training Issues and Challenges

## Current Challenges

### 1. Model Performance Degradation
- After approximately 500-600 training steps, model performance begins to deteriorate
- This suggests potential issues with training stability
- Current investigation:
  - Testing increased gradient accumulation steps to mitigate this issue
  - Monitoring learning curves and validation metrics more closely

### 2. Hardware Limitations
- Training is constrained by personal GPU VRAM (8GB)
- This limitation affects:
  - Model size selection (currently using smaller models)
  - Batch size configuration
  - Training efficiency

### 3. Model Size Considerations
- Current hypothesis: Models with 32B+ parameters would be more effective

## Mitigation Strategies

### Short-term Solutions
- Optimizing gradient accumulation steps
- Careful monitoring of training metrics
